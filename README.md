## Radix Sort
### Time Complexity:
- Best, Average, and Worst: O(d*(n + k)) where d is the number of digits in the largest number and k is the range of digits.
### Key Points:
- Non-comparative sorting algorithm that processes digits or characters.
- Efficient for sorting integers or strings when the range is limited.
- Requires extra space (not in-place).
- Stable algorithm.

## Counting Sort
### Time Complexity:
- Best, Average, and Worst: O(n + k), where k is the range of input values.
### Key Points:
- Suitable for small ranges of integer data.
Non-comparative algorithm that counts the occurrences of each element and calculates positions.
Requires extra space.
Stable sorting algorithm.
